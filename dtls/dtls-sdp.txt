Abstract

   This specification defines how to use Session Description Protocol
   (SDP) to signal that media will be transported over Datagram
   Transport Layer Security (DTLS) and it defines new SDP protocol
   identifiers.  This allows the security provided by the existing TCP/
   TLS specifications for stream transported media to also be applicable
   to media that is transported over a datagram oriented transport.

Internet-Draft                SDP for DTLS                  October 2005


1.  Introduction

   Session Description Protocol (SDP)[2] has been used to set up the
   transport of various types of media with RTP over UDP[7], TCP[4], and
   TLS[3].  DTLS[5] is a protocol for applying TLS security to datagram
   protocols such as UDP and DCCP[6].  This specification defines new
   SDP protocol identifiers that allow SDP to indicate that DTLS should
   be used to transport the media.

   The handling of TLS session in SDP is defined in [3] which discusses
   only TLS over TCP.  This document only extents that specification to
   also deal with TLS over datagram protocols such as UDP and DCCP.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [1].


3.  Session Description for RTP/AVP over DTLS

   This specification defines new tokens to describe the protocol used
   in SDP "m=" lines.  The new values defined for the proto field are:
   o  When a RTP/AVP stream is transported over DTLS with DCCP, then the
      token SHALL be DCCP/TLS/RTP/AVP.
   o  When a RTP/AVP stream is transported over DTLS with UDP, the token
      SHALL be UDP/TLS/RTP/AVP.
   o  When a RTP/AVP stream is transported over TLS with TCP, the token
      SHALL be TCP/TLS/RTP/AVP.
   o  When media is transported over DTLS with UDP, the token SHALL be
      UDP/TLS.
   o  When media is transported over DTLS with DCCP, the token SHALL be
      DCCP/TLS.

   For RTP profiles other than AVP, a new token should be defined in the
   form of DCCP/DTLS/RTP/xyz where xyz is replaced with an appropriate
   token for that profile.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This specification updates the "Session Description Protocol (SDP)
   Parameters" registry at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/sdp-parameters as defined in Appendix
   B of RFC 2327 [2].  Specifically it adds the following values to the
   table for the "proto" field.
