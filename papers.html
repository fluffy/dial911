A large number of drawings, however, exists only in a paper form. This thesis examines the problem of automatically converting such drawings and maps from raster image to high quality vector GIS or CAD forms.</p>										<p>This thesis begins with a review of previous work in the area and then proposes a new method based on findings about how human vision works and domain specific knowledge. Another system based on the classical work in this area is presented, to which the new system is compared. This comparison shows that the method proposed here obtains substantially better results than classical methods. The time a human operator could expect to spend correcting the errors created by this system would be less than one tenth of the time required to correct the errors created by a classical vectorization system. <a href="http:msc_thesis.pdf">PDF version of this thesis. </a></p>										<h2><a id="papers-ietf" name="papers-ietf"></a>IETF</h2>										<ul>											<li>RFC 3325 – “Private Extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for Asserted Identity within Trusted Networks” C.

This design removes the need for central servers from SIP, while offering full backward compatibility with SIP, allowing reuse of existing clients, and allowing P2P enabled nodes to communicate with conventional SIP entities. A basic introduction to the concepts of P2P is presented, backward compatibility issues addressed, and the security considerations are considered. This is very early work to explore the characteristics that a P2P system might have. It is less secure in many ways than the traditional approach to SIP but has certain other interesting characteristics that may make it desirable in some situations. This work is being discussed on the sipping@ietf.org mailing list.</li></ul></li><li>"The Message Session Relay Protocol", B. Campbell, R. Mahy, C.

Pager-mode messages stand alone and are not part of a SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) session, whereas Session-mode messages are set up as part of a session using the SIP protocol. MSRP (Message Sessions Relay Protocol) is a protocol for near-real-time, peer-to-peer exchanges of binary content without intermediaries, which is designed to be signaled using a separate rendezvous protocol such as SIP. This document introduces the notion of message relay intermediaries to MSRP and describes the extensions necessary to use them.</li></ul></li>																				                      <li>"Response Identity and Authentication in Session Initiation Protocol", F.

Some mechanisms are demonstrated for providing and verifying the identity of SIP responses. In order to prevent several kinds of security attacks through SIP response, SIP response authentication should be provided through a chain of trust of the SIP responses. Some extensions are proposed to enhance the per-hop authentication for handling SIP response. This draft is an early work in progress and suggests some approaches but there is still significant discussion needed. Some of the attacks discussed in this draft can be mitigated by using the sips URL.</li></ul></li>                      <li>"Managing Client Initiated Connections in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", C.

Mahy, July 2005, <a href="http://scm.sipfoundry.org/rep/ietf-drafts/fluffy/draft-ietf-sip-outbound-00.html">draft-ietf-sip-outbound-00</a><ul><li>Abstract: Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows proxy servers to initiate TCP connections and send asynchronous UDP datagrams to User Agents in order to deliver requests. However, many practical considerations, such as the existence of firewalls and NATs, prevent servers from connecting to User Agents in this way. Even when a proxy server can open a TCP connection to a User Agent, most User Agents lack a certificate suitable to act as a TLS server. This specification defines behaviors for user agents, registrars and proxy servers that allow requests to be delivered on existing connections established by the User Agent. It also defines keep alive behaviors needed to keep NAT bindings open and specifies the usage of multiple connections for high availability systems.</li></ul></li><li>"Certificate Management Service for The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)", C.

This mechanism allows user agents that want to contact a given Address-of-Record (AOR) to retrieve that AOR's certificate by subscribing to the Credential Service. The Credential Service also allows users to store and retrieve their own certificates and private keys.</li></ul></li><li>"NAT Classification Test Results", C.

Having a classification of the types of NATs that are being developed and deployed is useful in gauging the impact of various solutions. This draft records the results of classifying NATs. This draft is not complete and has only a few test results but it is worth discussing all the testing we wish to do before all the test results are collected.

This draft defines a way to allow a UAS to ask the UAC to compute a computationally expensive hash based function and present the result to the UAS. Although the computation is expensive for the UAC to compute, it is cheap for the UAS to verify. The solution also allows for proxies to compute and check the puzzle on behalf of the UAC or UAS.</li></ul></li>                      <li>"Example call flows using SIP security mechanisms", C.

This is necessary for making fair exchanges of service between two different communicating parties and is a major strategy for reducing the viability of SPAM. This draft proposes an approach for doing this in SIP. The approach relies on a third party to act as a payment service provider and is optimized for very simple, low value transactions. It does not provide the full range of services that are desirable in typical online trading systems. This draft is being discussed on the sipping@ietf.org mailing list.
